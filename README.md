# BARRY Drone (Work in progress)
BARRY Autonomously Runs Rotors yeah!

Aim of this project is to build a drone from scratch, then later use the platform to test autonomous functionality

Currently still on early testing, but I plan on using the platform to learn more about ROS and computer vision

[Original Attempt from when i was 15](https://github.com/Stargor14/Stone-Drone)

## Topics: Computer Vision, PID Control, ROS, wireless communication

Custom 3d Printed frame, raspi zero W for processing, esp32 for flight control, [rs2205 motors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001270601236.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.122.6ecf1802ioyX7h) and included escs

Using ps3 controller with [sixaxispairer](https://github.com/user-none/sixaxispairer) and [esp32-ps3](https://github.com/jvpernis/esp32-ps3) for flight testing

If i had the funding id love to explore the possibility of an autonomous drone swarm
